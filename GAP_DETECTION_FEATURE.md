# Gap Detection Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The gap detection feature identifies consecutive shotpoints without deployments on survey lines, helping identify areas that need coverage.

## Implementation Date
2025-10-27

## Components Added

### 1. Database Query Functions (telegram_bot_queries.py)
Located at lines 468-624:

- **get_line_gaps(line_number, min_gap_size=1)** - Lines 468-527
  - Detects consecutive shotpoints without deployments on a specific line
  - Returns list of gaps with start_shotpoint, end_shotpoint, and size
  - Configurable minimum gap size (default: 1 point - any missing shotpoint is a gap)

- **get_all_lines_with_gaps(min_gap_size=1)** - Lines 528-559
  - Finds all lines in the project that have gaps
  - Returns list of lines with their gaps
  - Useful for project-wide gap assessment

- **get_swath_gaps(swath_number, min_gap_size=1)** - Lines 560-588
  - Gap analysis for all lines within a specific swath
  - Returns gaps grouped by line within the swath

- **get_gap_statistics()** - Lines 589-624
  - Project-wide gap statistics
  - Categorizes lines by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
  - Provides total counts and percentages

### 2. Message Formatting Functions (telegram_bot_formatting.py)
Located at lines 495-609:

- **format_line_gaps(line_number, gaps)** - Lines 495-528
  - Formats gap report for a specific line
  - Includes severity assessment based on total gap points:
    - CRITICAL: >50 points
    - HIGH: 20-50 points
    - MEDIUM: 10-20 points
    - LOW: 5-10 points
  - Shows individual gap details (shotpoint ranges)

- **format_all_gaps_summary(lines_with_gaps, limit=20)** - Lines 529-570
  - Summary of all lines with gaps
  - Shows top lines sorted by total gap size
  - Includes line-by-line gap counts

- **format_gap_statistics(stats)** - Lines 571-609
  - Project-wide gap statistics formatting
  - Severity breakdown with visual indicators
  - Critical lines listing

### 3. Command Handler (telegram_bot_commands.py)
Located at lines 529-684:

- **cmd_gaps(chat_id, args)** - Lines 529-684
  - Main command handler for gap detection
  - Supports multiple sub-commands:
    - `/gaps` - Project-wide gap statistics
    - `/gaps line [number]` - Specific line gap analysis
    - `/gaps swath [1-8]` - Swath-wide gap analysis
    - `/gaps all` - All lines with gaps
  - Optional custom minimum gap size parameter
  - Comprehensive error handling

### 4. Help Documentation Updated
Updated help message in telegram_bot_formatting.py (lines 453-457) to include:
```
<b>üîç Gap Analysis</b>
/gaps - Project-wide gap statistics
/gaps line [number] - Line gap analysis
/gaps swath [1-8] - Swath gap analysis
/gaps all - All lines with gaps
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```
/gaps                    # Project-wide gap statistics
/gaps line 5000          # Check gaps on line 5000
/gaps swath 3            # Check gaps in swath 3
/gaps all                # List all lines with gaps
```

### Advanced Usage (Custom Gap Size)
```
/gaps line 5000 10       # Only show gaps of 10+ consecutive points
/gaps swath 3 8          # Only show gaps of 8+ consecutive points
```

## Gap Detection Algorithm

1. **Query Shotpoints**: Retrieves all shotpoints for the line with LEFT JOIN to deployments
2. **Identify Gaps**: Iterates through shotpoints marking consecutive ones without deployments
3. **Record Gap Ranges**: When deployments resume, records gap with:
   - Start shotpoint
   - End shotpoint
   - Gap size (number of consecutive empty points)
4. **Filter by Size**: Only includes gaps meeting minimum size threshold (default: 1 - any missing point)
5. **Categorize Severity**: Assigns priority based on total gap points per line

**Note**: Since even a single missing shotpoint is considered a gap, this ensures 100% coverage tracking.

## Severity Categories

| Category  | Gap Points | Icon | Description |
|-----------|-----------|------|-------------|
| CRITICAL  | >50       | üî¥   | Immediate attention required |
| HIGH      | 20-50     | üü°   | Significant gaps present |
| MEDIUM    | 10-20     | üü†   | Moderate gaps to address |
| LOW       | 5-10      | üü¢   | Minor gaps detected |

## Database Schema Requirements

The gap detection feature uses:
- **coordinates** table: line, shotpoint columns
- **global_deployments** table: line, shotpoint, deployment_type columns
- LEFT JOIN to identify shotpoints without any deployments

## Integration Points

1. **telegram_bot.py** - Main bot service calls CommandHandler.handle_message()
2. **CommandHandler** - Routes `/gaps` to cmd_gaps() method
3. **cmd_gaps()** - Calls DatabaseQueries methods based on sub-command
4. **DatabaseQueries** - Executes SQL queries to detect gaps
5. **TelegramFormatter** - Formats results for display
6. **Telegram API** - Sends formatted message to user

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Empty Line**: Line with no deployments (should show entire line as gap)
2. **Test Complete Line**: Line with all shotpoints deployed (should show no gaps)
3. **Test Partial Coverage**: Line with scattered deployments (should identify gaps)
4. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Single point gap (below minimum, should not show)
   - Exactly minimum size gap (should show)
   - Multiple small gaps vs. one large gap
5. **Test Swath-Wide**: Verify swath gap analysis aggregates correctly
6. **Test Custom Gap Size**: Verify custom minimum gap size parameter works

## Performance Considerations

- Queries use LEFT JOIN which is indexed on (line, shotpoint)
- Gap detection algorithm runs in O(n) time where n = number of shotpoints
- Statistics cache (5-minute TTL) should be considered for gap statistics
- For lines with 400-500 shotpoints, processing is near-instantaneous

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Gap Visualization**: Generate chart/heatmap of gaps across lines
2. **Export Gaps**: CSV export of all gaps for field planning
3. **Gap Alerts**: Automated alerts when new gaps appear or grow
4. **Gap Trends**: Track gap closure over time
5. **Field Assignments**: Assign teams to fill specific gaps
6. **GPS Coordinates**: Include lat/lon of gap midpoints for navigation

## Files Modified

1. `/home/aerys/Documents/ANTAN3D/telegram_bot_queries.py` - Added 4 new methods
2. `/home/aerys/Documents/ANTAN3D/telegram_bot_formatting.py` - Added 3 new methods, updated help
3. `/home/aerys/Documents/ANTAN3D/telegram_bot_commands.py` - Added cmd_gaps handler, registered in handler_map

## Status
‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Gap detection feature fully implemented and integrated.

All database queries, formatting functions, command handlers, and help documentation are in place and ready for testing.
